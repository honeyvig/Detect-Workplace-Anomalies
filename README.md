# Detect-Workplace-Anomalies
We want to build a solution that detects workplace anomalies on live cameras, e.g. fall detection, boundary monitoring, fire, and helmet-wearing.

The first part of the job will be achieving a few of the use cases, and based on the work quality, the rest of the project will be awarded.

Highlevel requirement is below, but there will be more use cases and will provide details to the wining bid.

- Helmet Compliance: Detect when employees are not wearing helmets in designated areas.
- Restricted Area Violations: Detect mobile phone usage, smoking, and loose clothing in hazardous or prohibited zones.
- Fall Detection: Automatically identify and alert on incidents where employees have fallen, ensuring timely responses.
- Boundary Wall Monitoring: Detect breaches or unauthorized access to the facility.
- Unauthorized Movement: Identify movement within restricted areas after working hours.
- Fire and Smoke Detection: Real-time monitoring for the presence of fire or smoke to ensure immediate response.
- Fire Equipment Surveillance: Ensure fire equipment is correctly placed and accessible.
- Employee Monitoring: Detect sleeping during work hours and mishandling of goods.
- Tool and Machine Monitoring: Alert for improper use of equipment and possible pilferage or theft.
- Vehicle and Parking Violations: Monitor vehicle search protocol compliance and parking violations.
- Criminal Activities Detection: Identify scuffles or unauthorized physical altercations in the workplace
- Coal Yard Surveillance: Monitor stacker movement and detect coal smothering or spillage.
- Leakage and Spillage Detection: Identify hazardous material spills or leakages in key areas.
- Height Safety Monitoring: Ensure that workers at height use safety harnesses properly.
- =========================
To build a solution that detects workplace anomalies using live cameras, you will need to utilize computer vision techniques, machine learning models, and real-time video processing.

    Smoke/fire detection models for fire and smoke detection
    Pre-trained models for anomaly detection or custom-trained models
    OpenCV DNN for deploying deep learning models

Explanation:

    Object Detection:
        We use YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection to identify helmets, phones, or other items that might violate workplace safety protocols.
    Fall Detection:
        This could be implemented by detecting posture or using a pre-trained fall detection model. Custom models can be built using CNN architectures for this use case.
    Fire and Smoke Detection:
        This leverages a custom fire detection model to identify smoke or fire. You could use TensorFlow or PyTorch to train such a model on fire-related images.
    Helmet Detection:
        We use OpenCVâ€™s Haar Cascade Classifier for detecting helmets. You could create a custom cascade for more accurate detection or fine-tune a deep learning model for this.
    Restricted Area Violations:
        This can be detected by analyzing the movements within certain boundaries. Background subtraction and motion detection techniques can be used to track movement.
    Integration with other systems:
        The system can be extended to include logging violations, sending alerts, and integrating with cloud services for real-time analytics.

Extensions & Deployment:

    You can improve the model training for each specific task using labeled data.
    API integration can allow this system to send real-time alerts (e.g., using Twilio or Firebase).
    Edge devices like Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson can be used for deployment in industrial settings.

Final Note:

This is a basic implementation to help kick-start the project. For production, consider optimizing performance, ensuring proper data privacy, and working on real-time processing with more advanced models.
